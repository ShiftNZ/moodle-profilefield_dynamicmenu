Dynamic menu user profile field for moodle
Now users can create user menu fields whose values are retrieved from the moodle DB.
Basically, the user can set a sql query as value definition of the filed. Please note that the query *must* return two fields: id and data.
Please note that this is an advanced plugin, mainly intended for developers and very avadanced moolde users. You must know moodle DB and sql language to use this plugin properly.
